# landing-page

This is my submission for The Odin Project's landing page project, used to demonstrate the CSS knowledge that I've gained, specifically in flexbox.

Special thanks to Lina Kolt (@lina-kolt-141441518), Omar Ramadan (@omar-ramadan-1739260), Thirdman (@thirdman), and Anna Shvets (@shvetsa), whose photography I found on pexels.com for use in this project.
